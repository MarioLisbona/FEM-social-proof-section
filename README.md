## My process
I worked from the outside in. I used a 2 x 2 grid as the main conatiner. I then used felxbox to style each grid item. I centered the star rating and testamonial cards then used `:first-child: flex-start` and `:last-child:flex-end` to arrange the div's in a staggered way.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
I learned how to use two differnt background images and to position them to diffent locations. I used flex-box and grid to style the page and have gained more confindence in using it. I have started to be able to look at a design brief and see straight away how i can use flex-box and grid in combination to acheive the style.

### Useful resources

- [Multiple Background Images](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp#:~:text=CSS%20allows%20you%20to%20add,is%20closest%20to%20the%20viewer.) - I didnt know that using multiple background images was an option available. This site showed me how to use this feature.

- [Web Dev Simplified - CSS](https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/) - This was a great course that taught css in an easy to undertand way.
